Ariadne is Python library for developing GraphQL APIs that aims to provide developer experience familiar to Apollo-Server.

**Warning**: The work on library is currently in experimental phase. We invite you to give Ariadne a try, but if you are looking to build production-ready GraphQL API, please use more stable solutions such as [Graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene).
