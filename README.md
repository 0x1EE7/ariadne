Ariadne is Python library for implementing [GraphQL](http://graphql.github.io/) servers, inspired by [Apollo Server](http://graphql.github.io/) and build with [GraphQL-Core](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core).

**Warning**: The work on library is currently in experimental phase. We invite you to give Ariadne a try, but if you are looking to build production-ready GraphQL API, please use more stable solutions such as [Graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene).
