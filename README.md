Ariadne is Python library for creating [GraphQL APIs](http://graphql.github.io/) using idiomatic approach, enabling you to use existing GraphQL resources in your work.

**Warning**: The work on library is currently in experimental phase. We invite you to give Ariadne a try, but if you are looking to build production-ready GraphQL API, please use more stable solutions such as [Graphene](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene).
