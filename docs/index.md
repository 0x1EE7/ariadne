Ariadne
=======

Ariadne is a Python library for implementing [GraphQL](http://graphql.github.io/) servers.

It exposes simple, easy to learn and extend API inspired by [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/), declaratory approach to types definition that uses standard [Schema Definition Language](https://graphql.github.io/learn/schema/) shared between GraphQL tools, production-ready WSGI middleware, simple dev server for local experiments and awesome GraphQL Playground for exploring your APIs.

Most of GraphQL standard is already supported, with only missing parts being unions, interfaces and inheritance, subscriptions.
